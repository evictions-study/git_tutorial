## What ___NOT___ to do (a.k.a. my dissertation)

```{r, out.width = "80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/messy.png")
```

## A better git workflow 

```{r, out.width = "90%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/bettergit.png")
```

# Why git?

## Version control & collaboration

* Version control is like an ***unlimited ‘undo’***.
* Version control also ***allows teams to work in parallel***.
* Primarily used for ***coding*** (python, R, sql, ), ***writing*** (markdown, latex, etc.), and many ***other formats***

## Reproducible code & public facing work

* Hosting [websites](https://evictions.study)
* Hosting [interactive maps](https://cci-ucb.github.io/sensitive_communities/map.html) and [code](https://github.com/cci-ucb/sensitive_communities)
* [Public facing documents](https://gitlab.com/timathomas/talks/-/tree/master/Presentation_PDFs)

## Work in parallel branches

* Your master is your primary working version (e.g. 1.0)
    * Don't ever work in the master, just in your branch
* When you want to make edits, you start a branch, make edits, then merge your work into the master

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/branching.png")
```

## <span style="color:red">*Caution:* <u>***Don't store data in a repo***</u></span>

Instead, use Google Drive or Box

Github repositories have about a 2gb limit and you can't push files bigger than 100mb at a time 

# Basic git principles

## Before git

* base version
* make some edits
* add more edits

```{r, out.width = "80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/whygit1.png")
```

## Collaboration

Make <u>**edits**</u> in your branch, <u>**commit**</u> your edits to the repo, and <u>**push**</u> to your branch in Github

```{r, out.width = "70%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/whygit2.png")
```

## Collaboration

Then, make a <u>**pull request**</u> to <u>**merge**</u> your edits into the master

```{r, out.width = "70%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/whygit3.png")
```

## git workflow summary

1. <u>***edit***</u> your file(s)
2. <u>***commit***</u> your changes (a.k.a. staging)
3. <u>***push***</u> to your branch on Github
4. <u>***merge***</u> your final edits into the master through a **pull request** on Github.com

<!-- # Prepare for activity 1 -->

<!-- ## Prep -->
<!-- 1. Download [Gihub desktop](https://desktop.github.com) -->
<!-- 1. Make a "git" directory in your Home directory -->
<!-- 1. Open the Github Desktop Application -->

# Activity 1

## Activity #1: Create a git repository on your local machine and push it to Github using [Github desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

1. Initalize a directory
2. Create a branch
3. Edit a file
4. Make a commit 
5. Publish to github
6. Make a pull request (i.e. merge from your branch to the master)

# Before we move on... some terminology 

## git terms

* **head** = the tip of your current branch
    * e.g. the master branch or my "tim" branch
* **origin** = the online head of the respective branch
    * you'll notice that Github Desktop says "fetch origin"
* **fetch** = tells your local git to retrieve the latest meta-data info from the original (yet doesn't do any file transfering. It's more like just checking to see if there are any changes available). 
* **pull** = on the other hand does that AND brings (copy) those changes from the remote repository (i.e. it ***merges*** the online changes to your local branch)

# Activity 2

## Activity 2: Clone a Github repo, make some edits, and merge it into the master

Using [Gihub desktop](https://desktop.github.com):

1. Move your `Github` folder to your Home directory and rename it `git`
1. Clone the repo https://github.com/timathomas/git_tutorial
1. Make a branch
3. Edit a file in the `git_tutorial/code/` directory
4. Commit your edits
5. Publish to github
6. Make a pull request

## How to deal with merge conflicts

## Some resources

* [Github's online tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

* [Github Desktop Tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop/creating-your-first-repository-using-github-desktop)

## Getting started 
1. Open `terminal` in windows or `powershell` in Windows


Creating a repository 

```{code}
cd ~/Desktop # navigate to a directory
mkdir planets # make a directory (folder) calles plamets
cd planets # move into that directory

git init # initialize the directory

ls # take a look inside

ls -a # look a little deeper

git status # check the git status
```
---

Tracking changes 

```
mkdir moons # make another directory called moons
nano mars.txt # create a text file using the core editor
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
    # press ctrl X, y, return
cat mars.txt # look at

git status # check the git status
git add mars.txt # stage mars.txt
git status # check the additions

git commit -m "Start notes on Mars as a base"
git status
```

After you commit, git takes everything we added (staged) and stores a permanent copy in the `.git` directory. This is called a [commit](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/reference#commit) and it's identifier is named in the commit output. 

--- 

Check the commit
```
git log
```

Adding some changes
```
nano mars.txt
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman

cat mars.txt

git status
git diff

git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"
    # this won't work until we add (stage) it

git add mars.txt
git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"
```

---

Let's add some more
```
nano mars.txt
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity

cat mars.txt

git diff

git add mars.txt
git diff
git diff --staged

git commit -m "Discuss concerns about Mars' climate for Mummy"

git status

git log
git log -1
git log --oneline
```

---

Exploring histories
```
nano mars.txt
An ill-considered change

git diff HEAD mars.txt

git add mars.txt
git commit -m "considerations"

git log
git log --oneline
git diff HEAD~1 mars.txt
git diff HEAD~2 mars.txt
```

---

Checkout an older version
```
git log --oneline

git checkout HEAD~2 mars.txt
cat mars.txt

git checkout HEAD mars.txt
cat mars.txt

git checkout HEAD~1 mars.txt
cat mars.txt
git add mars.txt
git commit -m "reverting to previous version"
```

---
## Branching
```
git branch wip
git branch

git checkout wip
git branch

nano mars.txt
Elon is giving us a ride tomorrow
git add mars.txt
git commit -m "travel plans"
cat mars.txt

git checkout master
cat mars.txt

git merge wip
cat mars.txt
git merge wip
cat mars.txt
```
* Don't work on the master branch

---

### Collaboration with [github.com](https://github.com)
* Github is great for public repos
* Gitlab is great for more security and private repos
* both allow collaboration

---

Make some commits and then do a pull request 
This way, collaborators can see what you're working on 
Name it 
```
WIP: ....
```

---
### Connecting your local repository to github.com
...push an existing repository from the command line
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/timathomas/planets.git
git push -u origin master 
```

When you're on a branch
```
git push origin <branch name>
```

---

```
echo "*~" >> .gitignore

git add .gitignore
git commit -m "add .gitignore"
git push origin master 
```

---
### My Workflow
* Start or fork a repo
* clone the online repo to my local machine
* make some base edits to the README.md
* BRANCH! (Stay off the master)
    - If I'm collaborating, do a pull request online sooner than later
        + label it `WIP: branch name`
    - Stage and commit often (like your habit of saving a file)

---
### My Workflow
* After you've completed a task or reached a goal, merge your branch to the master.
    - If you're collaborating, merge through the online repo, not through the terminal

### Suggestions
* Keep a log.md and update the README.md file often

---

#### My favorite tools
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)
    - Others [Atom](https://atom.io) (sluggish in my opinion)
    - Favorite Sublime Packages
        + Git, Gitgutter, Thesaurus, LanguageTool, R-IDE, SendCode, Terminal
* [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com) to view complex branches
